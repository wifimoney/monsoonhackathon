## reverse-engineering
Contains the source code used to reverse engineer the ABI,
which includes abi1.json which I still don't know what is for

It appears you can't delegateStake to the same validator more than once.

## STAKER-FULL.json
Includes the entire ABI reverse engineered from https://testnet.somnia.network/staking

## STAKER.json
Only includes the non-admin ABI part that is actually useful from STAKER-FULL.json

## validators.json
Reverse engineered list of validator addresses
